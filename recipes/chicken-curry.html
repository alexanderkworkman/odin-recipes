        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Murgh Kari makes use of a potent spice blend that includes garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper to create the perfect chicken curry dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
        </ol>
